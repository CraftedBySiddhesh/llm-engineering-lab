Here are some Q&As based on the text:\n\nQ: Who helped Paul Graham with reading drafts of his work?\nA: Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar [S1].\n\nQ: What programming language did Paul Graham use in the early days?\nA: An early version of Fortran [S2].\n\nQ: What was the process of running a program like back then?\nA: You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it [S2].\n\nQ: What problem did Paul Graham face with running a forum and writing essays?\nA: He had to respond to misinterpretations of his essays on the forum, as not responding would be seen as a tacit admission that they were correct [S3].\n\nQ: What did Paul Graham learn from programs like SHRDLU?\nA: That there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language, but there's an unbridgeable gap between what these programs can do and actually understanding natural language [S4].\n\nWant to ask more questions or discuss something specific? I'm all ears!"
